# Hi there! 👋 I'm Shishir

I'm a Software Engineer with a mix of enterprise experience, currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at San Jose State University.

### 🏢 Professional Experience

I have nearly 5 years of professional experience spanning both large enterprises and startups. Throughout my career, I've worked with a variety of tools, specializing in building serverless applications using TypeScript, though I'm also well-versed in Python and Java. Currently, I'm diving into Rust and exploring the world of AI.

### 💻 Tech Stack
I'm proficient in:
- **Languages:** TypeScript, Python, Java, Rust (currently learning!)
- **Web Development:** React, Node.js
- **Databases:** SQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, DynamoDB
- **Cloud Services:** AWS (CDK, SDK, Lambda, API Gateway, S3, RDS, and more)

### 🤖 Exploring AI
I'm also exploring the field of Artificial Intelligence, focusing on tools like LangChain, ChatGPT, and AWS Bedrock to build intelligent solutions. Recently, I developed a proof of concept for a chatbot that utilizes LLMs and vector databases to deliver real-time, data-driven responses.

### 🌱 Learning
I'm excited about learning Rust and exploring how I can integrate it into backend systems for performance-critical applications.
